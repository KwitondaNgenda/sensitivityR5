#' Simulated matched sample for class EPBI 500 class at Case Western Reserve University

#' The Data Set is 100% fictional, and is available as toy.csv on the course website. It #' 70 treated - subjects 131-200 and 130 controls -     #' subjects 1-130  on treatment status. It has three outcomes, with no    #' missing observations anywhere. We assume that a logical argument suggests that the   #' square of covA, as well as the interactions of covB with covC and with covD should be #' related to treatment assignment, and thus should be included in our propensity model.
